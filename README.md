# CodeClauseInternship_BlindnessDetection

## Overview

This deep learning project uses the ResNet-50 model to detect blindness based on the APTOS 2019 dataset from Kaggle.

## Description

Our project aims to address the challenge of early blindness detection using deep learning. We utilize the APTOS 2019 dataset, which consists of retinal images. By training a ResNet-50 model on this dataset, we aim to classify images into  five different stages of retinal disease.
